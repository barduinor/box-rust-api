/// RepresentationsEntriesInnerContent : An object containing the URL that can be used to actually fetch the representation.



#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Default, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct RepresentationsEntriesInnerContent {
    /// The download URL that can be used to fetch the representation. Make sure to make an authenticated API call to this endpoint.  This URL is a template and will require the `{+asset_path}` to be replaced by a path. In general, for unpaged representations it can be replaced by an empty string.  For paged representations, replace the `{+asset_path}` with the page to request plus the extension for the file, for example `1.pdf`.  When requesting the download URL the following additional query params can be passed along.  * `set_content_disposition_type` - Sets the `Content-Disposition` header in the API response with the specified disposition type of either `inline` or `attachment`. If not supplied, the `Content-Disposition` header is not included in the response.  * `set_content_disposition_filename` - Allows the application to   define the representation's file name used in the   `Content-Disposition` header.  If not defined, the filename   is derived from the source file name in Box combined with the   extension of the representation.
