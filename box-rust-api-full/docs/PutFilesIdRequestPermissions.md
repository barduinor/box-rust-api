Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**can_download** | Option<**String**> | Defines who is allowed to download this file. The possible values are either `open` for everyone or `company` for the other members of the user's enterprise.  This setting overrides the download permissions that are normally part of the `role` of a collaboration. When set to `company`, this essentially removes the download option for external users with `viewer` or `editor` a roles. | [optional]
