## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**name** | Option<**String**> | The name of the folder. | [optional]
**sequence_id** | Option<**String**> | A numeric identifier that represents the most recent user event that has been applied to this item.  This can be used in combination with the `GET /events`-endpoint to filter out user events that would have occurred before this identifier was read.  An example would be where a Box Drive-like application would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming user events for changes to the item. The application would ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally fetched resource. | [optional]
