/// SignTemplateAllOfReadySignLink : Box's ready-sign link feature enables you to create a link to a signature request that you've created from a template. Use this link when you want to post a signature request on a public form — such as an email, social media post, or web page — without knowing who the signers will be. Note: The ready-sign link feature is limited to Enterprise Plus customers and not available to Box Verified Enterprises.
