# FolderMini

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **String** | The unique identifier that represent a folder.  The ID for any folder can be determined by visiting a folder in the web application and copying the ID from the URL. For example, for the URL `https://_*.app.box.com/folders/123` the `folder_id` is `123`. | 
**etag** | Option<**String**> | The HTTP `etag` of this folder. This can be used within some API endpoints in the `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` headers to only perform changes on the folder if (no) changes have happened. | [optional]
**r#type** | **String** | `folder` | 
**name** | Option<**String**> | The name of the folder. | [optional]
**sequence_id** | Option<**String**> | A numeric identifier that represents the most recent user event that has been applied to this item.  This can be used in combination with the `GET /events`-endpoint to filter out user events that would have occurred before this identifier was read.  An example would be where a Box Drive-like application would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming user events for changes to the item. The application would ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally fetched resource. | [optional]
